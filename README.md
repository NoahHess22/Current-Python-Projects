# Current-Python-Projects
Here are some of the python projects I am working on currently at Trine University. Next semester, I will begin learning C++ and will add those as well. So far we have mostly done only small practice programs (Those weren't included), but I have also spent time working on my own python projects for fun to help me understand concepts while taking the class.
